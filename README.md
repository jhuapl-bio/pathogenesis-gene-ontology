# pathogenesis-gene-ontology

This ontology contains terms to describe the function of genes and gene products involved in pathogenesis.  Genes that encode toxins, virulence factors, and antimicrobial resistance have functions that are not represented well by the terms contained within the Gene Ontology or any of the other OBO Foundry ontologies.  This ontology will collect and maintain common terms and descriptions of concepts related to pathogenesis, and could help provide more intuitive descriptions of function for these types of sequences.

## Versions

### Stable release versions

The latest version of the ontology can always be found at:

http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/pathgo.owl

(note this will not show up until the request has been approved by OBO Foundry)

### Editors' version

Those wishing to edit this ontology should use the "-edit" version, [src/ontology/pathgo-edit.owl](src/ontology/pathgo-edit.owl)

## Contact

Please use this repository's [Issue tracker](https://github.com/rjacak/pathogenesis-gene-ontology/issues) to request new terms/classes or report errors or specific concerns related to the ontology.  We would love to hear from you!
