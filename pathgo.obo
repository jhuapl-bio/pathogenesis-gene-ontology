It may facilitate the binding of venom component RV-4 to presynaptic binding sites, acting as a chaperone and minimizing the destruction of RV-4 by binding to extraneous targets. The RV-7/RV-4 heterodimer targets presynaptic sites at the neuromuscular junction [PMID8835338].\n\nTerm suggested by Gene Godbold (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5702-4690)" xsd:string
